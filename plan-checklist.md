## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Data Layer**: Austin 311 public dataset (pre-loaded in BigQuery)
2. **AI Processing**: Native BigQuery AI functions (no external infrastructure)
3. **Storage**: BigQuery tables for processed insights and forecasts  
4. **Visualization**: Looker Studio dashboard (real-time updates)
5. **Presentation**: Kaggle notebook + GitHub repo + demo video

### Key SQL Functions
- `AI.GENERATE_TABLE`: Multi-column summarization and analysis
- `AI.FORECAST`: Time-series prediction for ticket volumes
- `VECTOR_SEARCH` (optional): Semantic similarity for historical matching

### Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: Automated analysis reduces manual work by 80%
- **Accuracy**: AI-generated insights match human analysis quality  
- **Speed**: Real-time dashboard updates vs. weekly manual reports
- **Scalability**: Handles growing ticket volumes without additional resources

## üìä Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **BigQuery AI limits**: Use sample data subsets if hitting quotas
- **Dashboard performance**: Optimize queries and add caching
- **Data quality**: Validate Austin 311 data completeness

### Timeline Risks  
- **Scope creep**: Stick to core features, avoid over-engineering
- **Technical issues**: Have fallback datasets and simpler visualizations ready
- **Submission deadline**: Complete core features first, polish later
