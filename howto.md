## 🔧 Phase 2: BigQuery Deployment (45 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Enable BigQuery AI Features
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable the following APIs:
   - BigQuery API
   - Vertex AI API (for AI functions)
   - BigQuery ML API

3. Set up authentication:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

### Step 2.2: Execute SQL Files in Order

**Option A: Using Local Python Script (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/bigquery-support-bot

# Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login

# Run automated deployment script
python run_local.py
```

**Option B: Using BigQuery CLI**
Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` in all SQL files with your actual project ID, then execute:
```bash
# Set project ID
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
# export PROJECT_ID="animated-graph-458306-r5"

# Execute files in order
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/01_setup_dataset.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/02_daily_insights.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/03_volume_forecast.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/04_vector_embeddings.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/05_semantic_search.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/06_dashboard_data.sql
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=$PROJECT_ID < sql/07_summary_stats.sql
```

**Option C: Manual BigQuery Console**
Execute each file individually in the BigQuery console:

1. **Dataset Setup** (`sql/01_setup_dataset.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- Creates support_demo dataset and imports Austin 311 data
   -- Expected runtime: 2-3 minutes
   -- Cost: ~$0.10
   ```

2. **Daily Insights** (`sql/02_daily_insights.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- AI.GENERATE_TABLE for structured analysis
   -- Expected runtime: 3-5 minutes
   -- Cost: ~$2.50
   ```

3. **Volume Forecast** (`sql/03_volume_forecast.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- AI.FORECAST for 30-day predictions
   -- Expected runtime: 2-3 minutes  
   -- Cost: ~$1.25
   ```

4. **Vector Embeddings** (`sql/04_vector_embeddings.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING for similarity
   -- Expected runtime: 5-7 minutes
   -- Cost: ~$3.75
   ```

5. **Semantic Search** (`sql/05_semantic_search.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- VECTOR_SEARCH demonstrations
   -- Expected runtime: 1-2 minutes
   -- Cost: ~$0.50
   ```

6. **Dashboard Data** (`sql/06_dashboard_data.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- Views for Looker Studio
   -- Expected runtime: 30 seconds
   -- Cost: ~$0.05
   ```

7. **Summary Stats** (`sql/07_summary_stats.sql`):
   ```sql
   -- Performance metrics and ROI analysis
   -- Expected runtime: 1 minute
   -- Cost: ~$0.25
   ```

### Step 2.3: Verify Deployment
Check that all tables were created successfully:
```sql
SELECT table_name, row_count, size_bytes
FROM `animated-graph-458306-r5.support_demo.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE`
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Expected tables (✅ Verified Working):
- `raw_tickets_staging` (8,469 rows) - Original CSV import
- `raw_tickets` (8,469 rows) - Processed customer support data
- `daily_insights` (721 rows) - Daily aggregated insights (2020-2021)
- `summary_stats` (1 row) - Performance metrics and ROI analysis

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check raw tickets data
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=animated-graph-458306-r5 "
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tickets, COUNT(DISTINCT category) as categories 
FROM \`animated-graph-458306-r5.support_demo.raw_tickets\`"

# Check daily insights
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=animated-graph-458306-r5 "
SELECT COUNT(*) as daily_records, MIN(event_date), MAX(event_date) 
FROM \`animated-graph-458306-r5.support_demo.daily_insights\`"

# Check summary stats
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=animated-graph-458306-r5 "
SELECT total_tickets_analyzed, estimated_annual_cost_savings_usd 
FROM \`animated-graph-458306-r5.support_demo.summary_stats\`"
```

from google.cloud import bigquery
client = bigquery.Client()
query = 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \`YOUR_PROJECT_ID.support_demo.daily_insights\`'
print(f'Records: {list(client.query(query))[0][0]}')
"
```

### Monitoring and Debugging
```bash
# Check job status
bq ls -j --max_results=10

# View job details
bq show -j JOB_ID

# Monitor costs
bq query --dry_run --use_legacy_sql=false < sql/04_vector_embeddings.sql
