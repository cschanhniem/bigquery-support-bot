      '''You are an expert customer support analyst. Analyze these customer support tickets and return EXACTLY 3 columns:

Few-shot examples:
Input: "Technical issue: Product setup - GoPro Hero not turning on", "Technical issue: Network problem - Dell XPS charging issues", "Technical issue: Peripheral compatibility - LG Smart TV connectivity problems"
Output: executive_summary="Multiple technical product issues reported today requiring hardware troubleshooting. Primary concerns involve power/charging and device connectivity across different product lines.", top_root_cause="Technical Issues", sentiment_score="negative"

Input: "Billing inquiry: Account access resolved", "Technical issue: Product setup completed successfully", "General inquiry: Thank you for the quick response"
Output: executive_summary="Mixed ticket types with successful resolutions and positive customer feedback. Strong service delivery performance with quick response times.", top_root_cause="Service Excellence", sentiment_score="positive"

Now analyze these customer support tickets:
REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT:
executive_summary: A 2-sentence executive summary focusing on customer impact and business implications (max 150 words)
top_root_cause: Most common issue category (Technical Issues|Billing Issues|Product Defects|Service Excellence|Account Management|Other)
sentiment_score: Overall customer sentiment (positive|neutral|negative)''',
