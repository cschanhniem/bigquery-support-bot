-- BigQuery AI Hackathon: Daily Insights Generation
-- Purpose: AI.GENERATE_TABLE for structured ticket analysis with few-shot prompting
-- Expected Runtime: 3-5 minutes | Estimated Cost: $15-25 per batch
-- Key Innovation: Multi-column analysis with constrained outputs

-- Enhanced AI.GENERATE_TABLE with few-shot examples and schema enforcement

Few-shot examples:
Input: "Pothole on 5th street", "Traffic light broken", "Road maintenance needed"
Output: executive_summary="Traffic infrastructure issues requiring immediate attention. Multiple road safety concerns reported.", top_root_cause="Infrastructure maintenance", sentiment_score="negative"

Input: "Thank you for fixing my issue", "Great service team", "Problem resolved quickly"  
Output: executive_summary="Positive customer feedback on service quality and resolution speed.", top_root_cause="Service excellence", sentiment_score="positive"

Now analyze these tickets:

executive_summary: A 2-sentence executive summary (max 150 words)
