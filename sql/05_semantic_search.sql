-- BigQuery AI Hackathon: Semantic Similarity Search
-- Purpose: VECTOR_SEARCH for intelligent ticket matching
-- Expected Runtime: 1-2 minutes per query | Estimated Cost: $2-5 per search
-- Innovation: Meaning-based search vs traditional keyword matching

-- ðŸš€ CORE INNOVATION: VECTOR_SEARCH with business context
