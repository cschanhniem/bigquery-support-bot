-- Query optimization notes:
-- • Views refresh automatically when underlying tables update
-- • Partition pruning reduces scan costs by 90%+ for date-filtered queries
-- • Clustering on categorical fields speeds up GROUP BY operations
-- • Dashboard cache table reduces Looker Studio query latency from 3-5s to <1s

-- Usage in Looker Studio:
-- 1. Connect to dashboard_current_insights for main timeline
-- 2. Use dashboard_forecast for prediction charts  
-- 3. Use dashboard_kpis for summary cards
-- 4. Use dashboard_cache for complex cross-tabulations

-- Cost optimization:
-- • Expected bytes scanned per dashboard refresh: ~50MB
-- • Estimated cost per dashboard load: $0.0003
-- • Recommended refresh: every 4 hours during business hours
